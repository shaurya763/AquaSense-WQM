##Problem Statement

Currently, water quality issues are often reported through manual processes, which leads to delays, lack of transparency, and poor tracking. Many citizens are unaware of water safety standards and the environmental impact of pollution.
The absence of a unified platform for water quality complaints and awareness results in:
•	Delayed response to contamination issues
•	Lack of public awareness
•	Inefficient data management
Aqua Sense addresses these problems by providing an online system that enables awareness dissemination and structured complaint handling.

##Objectives:
•	To create awareness about water quality and pollution
•	To provide a platform for raising water-related complaints
•	To support SDG-6 initiatives
•	To maintain structured data for water issues
